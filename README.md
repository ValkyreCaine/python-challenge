Hello there!

This project as part of UCI's Data Anyltics Bootcamp demonstrates the step up from excel/ VBA into one of the most commonly used coding languages, python with limited libraries! 

It is broken up into two folders, PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank:
I was tasked with creating a python script to analyze financial records of a company. The script I created writes a file at the end including the Financial Analysis.

Financial Analysis
-------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: -8311.105882352942
Greatest Increase in Profits: ['16-Aug', 1862002]
Greatest Decrease in Profits: ['14-Feb', -1825558] 

PyPoll:
In this scenario I decided to help a small rural town modernize their vote-counting process with Python.
The script I wrote iterates through the votes, counting each and provides a summary at the end by writing a new text file including the Election Results.

Election Results
------------------
Total Votes:369711
------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
--------------
Winner: Diana DeGette

The course provided me with the datasets and sample code to start with.
